🌟 The Last Step

A young woman named Asha loved running. Not because she was the fastest, or because she won medals—she simply loved the feeling of moving forward.

One year, she signed up for a mountain trail race. Everyone told her it was too hard, too steep, too long. Asha wasn’t sure if she could finish, but she wanted to try.

The race began well, but halfway up the mountain, her legs started to ache and the thin air made it hard to breathe. As runners passed her, she began to doubt herself.

She thought of quitting.

Just then, an older woman running beside her slowed down and said,
“You don’t have to conquer the mountain. Just take one more step. Then one more.”

Asha nodded. She took one step. Then another. She focused only on the next small moment, not the huge climb ahead.

Hours later, as the sun began to set, Asha reached the top. She wasn’t first. She wasn’t even in the middle. But when she saw the breathtaking view, she realized something powerful:

Sometimes success is not about being the fastest.
It’s about refusing to stop.
About choosing the next step, even when it’s hard.

From that day on, whenever life felt overwhelming, Asha whispered to herself:

“Just one more step.”
